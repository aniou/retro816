# retro816
port [RETRO(http://retroforth.org/) Forth] created by by [Charles Childers](https://www.patreon.com/_crc) to 65c816.

This port is in infancy and there are dark and spooky things inside,
but at this moment is able to run simple code in 1:1 pair to one of
original interpreters (`vm/nga-c/barebones`).
